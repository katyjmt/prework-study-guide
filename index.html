        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>h1 - h6 elements represent headings. h1 should only be used once on each page.</li>
          <li>The ul tag creates an unordered list of items. Within the ul tag, li tags are wrapped around each item to list them one-by-one.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>To link a stylesheet to a html file, add <link rel="stylesheet" href="___"> to the head of the page. Rel explains the relationship between the two files and href is the file path</li>
          <li>A class selector can be applied to HTML elements then referred back to in the CSS to apply styles specifically to the elements with that class.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switch to the main branch</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pull down the latest main branch - should do this before you start making updates, then also before pushing up any changes. This will require password if SSH not set up for computer</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: when you've made changes to a directory (and are sitting on it) stage all of your changes using this command</li>
          <li>git commit -m "added code to HTML file": commit changes to repo (-m is the message to associate with this)</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/add-html: push changes to github. This will require password if SSH not set up for computer</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript variables are containers used to store information. Use let or const to declare a variable</li>
          <li>Conditional logic allows you to run code only when a specific condition / conditions is / are met. The structure for this is 'if(condition) {code block to execute if condition is true} else {code block to execute if condition is false};'</li>
          <li>Arrays are groups of related data, stored in the format var = [data1, data2, data3]</li>
          <li>For loops allow you to iterate through arrays and other data types. They have the structure 'for(var x = 0; x < varName.length; x++) {code block to be executed for each item in array};'. The components of this are 'what index to start on', 'how far to iterate' and 'how to iterate'</li>
          <li>Functions are stored series of instructions that can be called to perform said instructions. There are several ways to define a function, one example is 'function functionName() {code block to be executed};'</li>
