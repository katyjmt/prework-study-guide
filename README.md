# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This guide provides an easy reference for topics covered during the pre-work phase of Monash Coding Bootcamp. It includes sections for each introductory topic, including HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript, making it quick and easy to refer back to core concepts and the syntax for each. Having to articuate each new concept in my own words has helped to speed up the learning process. I was already familiar with HTML, CSS and basic JS prior to the pre-work, however the guide has been particularly helpful as a quick reference to Git commands, which are completely new to me.
